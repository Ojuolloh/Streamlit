THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TELCO CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION APP

This project’s Telco Churn Prediction App uses machine learning to examine a variety of customer variables, such as contract terms and service consumption. Businesses can improve customer satisfaction and retention strategies by customizing retention techniques based on the app’s ability to predict client churn.

In addition to its technical capabilities, the Telco Churn Prediction App has a user-friendly design. Its well-thought-out online interface leads customers step-by-step through the

prediction process, letting them enter client data with well-known options like gender, contract type, and service consumption via radio buttons or numeric inputs.

This means there is no intimidating code or complicated jargon for non-technical people. Alternatively, customers can interact with the app in a comfortable manner to get insights that help them make important decisions. Technical users, meanwhile, can comprehend the underlying Machine Learning techniques and effectively share findings with their peers.

There are 5 pages in the Telco Churn Prediction App: Home, Data, Dashboard, Predict, and History. Every page has been carefully planned to promote user engagement and guarantee a flawless experience. These images depict the user interface of the app on each page:
